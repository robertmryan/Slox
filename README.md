# Slox

This is a Swift rendition of Robert Nystrom’s [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)’s Lox.

As it stands, this version 0.1 workspace is just the initial template for Lox, not yet a functional interpreter.

This Xcode Workspace consists of three projects:

 * SloxApp: A SwiftUI GUI front-end
 * SloxCLI: A macOS CLI front-end (whose executable is `slox`)
 * SloxKit: A framework target for the Lox interpreter

You can open the `.xcworkspace` from macOS Finder, or type `xed .` from the command line (when in this folder).

This was Built in Xcode 16.3.
